[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13127); [Homepage](metacloak.github.io); 

The complete code and data will be released upon acceptance. Four sampled IDs from VGGFace2 (clean and protected images with our method with $r=11/255$) are released under the `./example_data/` folder. Free feel to test out the protection performance.
